\title{Validation of Bellerophon NACA 0012 wing in 2D flow}
\author{Andreas Gro√ü}

\section{Case Description}
This test case compares the results for a steady turbulent flow over a NACA 0012
profile at a range of angles of attack. 

The Reynolds number of this test case is \(2.88\times10^6\). For turbulence modeling
the \(k\text{-}\epsilon\)-model is used\cite{kEps}. Different mesh sizes are used for
validation of the methods used. \textbf{TODO}

Results are compared against the validation results provided by Ladson\cite{Ladson1}, Ladson et al.\cite{Ladson2} and
Gregory et al.\cite{Gregory}.

\section{Results}

The lift coefficient for angles of attack between \(0^\circ\) and \(20^\circ\) are
shown in Figure~\ref{Lift}. There is a good agreement for lift at low and moderate angles
of attack. For high angles of attack, the calculation predict a lower lift then the experiments.
The calculated drag is shown in Figure~\ref{Lift} and is higher then the drag measured.

A comparison of the pressure distribution at angles of attack of \(0^\circ\) and \(10^\circ\) is
shown in Figures~\ref{CP}. The results for \(0^\circ\) show good agreement with the experimental
results. For \(10^\circ\) the experimental results differ in the pressure peak at the upper
surface\cite{Gregory}\cite{Ladson2}. The results by Gergory et al. seem to resolve this peak
better as they might be considered to be more two dimensional. The calculations show good agreement
with these data.
